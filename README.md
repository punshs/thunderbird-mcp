# Thunderbird MCP — punshs fork

Public fork of [TKasperczyk/thunderbird-mcp](https://github.com/TKasperczyk/thunderbird-mcp), retaining the upstream MIT license and attribution. This branch integrates upstream v0.7.5 with cross-folder conversations, explicit completed folder refresh, folder-local threads, Snap discovery fixes, and Outlook-style HTML replies. Plain-text input is escaped into Outlook-style HTML composition, preserving Aptos styling and normal paragraph wrapping. The `isHtml` flag describes input markup, not compose-window mode. Upstream automatic add-on updates are disabled so they cannot replace the fork; install fork builds manually.

The bridge uses upstream protocol negotiation and metadata-only debug logging. Earlier experimental full-payload trace logging is superseded to avoid logging message content. Open-draft editing is available through the four compose-window tools below. Automatic duplicate prevention and persistent send-status tracking remain future work.

> Inspired by [bb1/thunderbird-mcp](https://github.com/bb1/thunderbird-mcp). Rewritten from scratch with a bundled HTTP server, proper MIME decoding, and UTF-8 handling throughout.

---

## Why?

Thunderbird has no official API for AI tools. Your AI assistant can't read your email, can't help you draft replies, can't organize your inbox. This extension fixes that -- it exposes 47 tools over MCP so any compatible AI (Claude, GPT, local models) can work with your mail the way you'd expect.

Mail sends and event/task creation require review by default because **Block `skipReview`** starts enabled. `skipReview: true` is honored only after you explicitly disable that safety setting. **By default, nothing is sent or created without your review.**

---

## How it works

```
                    stdio              HTTP (localhost:8765-8774)
  MCP Client  <----------->  Bridge  <--------------------->  Thunderbird
  (Claude, etc.)           mcp-bridge.cjs                    Extension + HTTP Server
```

The Thunderbird extension embeds a local HTTP server with session-scoped auth tokens. The Node.js bridge translates between MCP's stdio protocol and HTTP, discovering the port and token automatically via a connection file. The bridge handles MCP lifecycle methods (initialize, ping) locally, so clients can connect even before Thunderbird is fully loaded.

## What you can do

### Mail

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `listAccounts` | List all email accounts and their identities |
| `listFolders` | Browse folder tree with message counts -- filter by account or subtree |
| `refreshFolders` | Explicitly synchronize selected remote folders and wait for bounded completion. Each folder reports `refreshed`, `skipped`, `timed_out`, or `failed`; partial failures remain visible. By default, refreshes Inbox and Sent folders for accessible accounts. |
| `getThread` | List every message in a conversation, oldest first, from either a `messageId` or a `threadId`. Headers plus preview only -- call `getMessage` for bodies. Uses Thunderbird's own threading, so results are folder-local. |
| `getConversation` | List exact header-linked messages across folders in the seed account, including Sent replies. Uses message IDs and compatible Outlook thread headers, never subject equality alone. Headers only -- call `getMessage` for bodies. |
| `searchMessages` | Search by subject, sender, recipient, body preview, date range, or tags. Multi-word queries are AND-of-tokens (every word must appear somewhere). Prefix with `from:`, `subject:`, `to:`, or `cc:` to restrict to one field. Set `searchBody: true` for full-text body search via Thunderbird's Gloda index. Supports `includeSubfolders`, `countOnly`, and offset-based pagination. Results include `threadId` and `preview` snippet. By default, `dedupByMessageId` collapses the same RFC Message-ID found in multiple folders/labels into one row and reports the other folder paths in `dupLocations`; set `dedupByMessageId: false` to return every location. |
| `getMessage` | Read full email content -- `bodyFormat`: `markdown` (default), `text`, or `html`. Set `rawSource: true` for the complete RFC 2822 source (all headers + MIME parts). Optional attachment saving. Set `includeInlineImages: true` to append supported inline CID images as MCP image blocks (PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP; max 1 MiB base64 per image and 4 MiB total). Skipped images are reported in attachment metadata. |
| `getMessages` | Read full email content for up to the configured batch limit in one call (default 10, max 20). Uses the same `bodyFormat`, `rawSource`, and attachment options as `getMessage`; each item supplies `messageId` and `folderPath`. |
| `getRecentMessages` | Get recent messages with date, unread, and tag filtering. Supports pagination. Results include `threadId` and `preview`. |
| `displayMessage` | Open a message in Thunderbird's GUI -- `3pane` (default), `tab`, or `window` mode |
| `updateMessage` | Mark read/unread, flag/unflag, add/remove tags, move between folders, or trash -- supports bulk via `messageIds` |
| `deleteMessages` | Delete messages -- drafts are safely moved to Trash |
| `createFolder` | Create new subfolders to organize your mail |
| `renameFolder` | Rename an existing mail folder |
| `deleteFolder` | Delete a folder (moves to Trash, or permanently deletes if already in Trash) |
| `moveFolder` | Move a folder to a new parent within the same account |
| `emptyTrash` | Permanently delete all messages in Trash (including subfolders) |
| `emptyJunk` | Permanently delete all messages in Junk/Spam (including subfolders) |

### Compose

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `listComposeWindows` | List accessible open drafts with unique IDs, revisions, subjects, recipients and attachment metadata. |
| `getComposeWindow` | Read a particular open draft, including its current body, source-message URI, saved-draft URI and revision. |
| `updateComposeWindow` | Change selected fields in an existing window; reject stale revisions and preserve untouched fields. Does not send or save. |
| `saveComposeWindow` | Save the observed revision to Drafts and leave it open; never sends or queues mail. |
| `sendMail` | Compose a new email -- opens a review window; direct sending requires explicitly disabling the `skipReview` safety block |
| `replyToMessage` | Reply with quoted original and proper threading -- `skipReview` is subject to the same safety block |
| `forwardMessage` | Forward with all original attachments preserved -- `skipReview` is subject to the same safety block |

All compose tools open a window for you to review and edit before sending by default. The **Block `skipReview`** preference is on by default, so `skipReview: true` is rejected until you explicitly disable the preference; only then can it send directly. Attachments can be file paths or inline base64 objects.

Compose tools validate the `from` identity strictly -- if the specified sender doesn't match any configured Thunderbird identity, the tool returns an error instead of silently substituting another account.

### Filters

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `listFilters` | List all filter rules with human-readable conditions and actions |
| `createFilter` | Create filters with structured conditions (from, subject, date...) and actions (move, tag, flag...) |
| `updateFilter` | Modify a filter's name, enabled state, conditions, or actions |
| `deleteFilter` | Remove a filter by index |
| `reorderFilters` | Change filter execution priority |
| `applyFilters` | Run filters on a folder on demand -- let your AI organize your inbox |

Full control over Thunderbird's message filters. Changes persist immediately. Your AI can create sorting rules, adjust priorities, and run them on existing mail.

### Contacts

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `searchContacts` | Search contacts across all address books by email or name and return full contact details. Supports `maxResults`. |
| `getContact` | Read full contact details by UID |
| `createContact` | Create a contact with optional email/name, phones, postal addresses, organization, title, note, and birthday. Phone-only contacts are supported. |
| `updateContact` | Update contact fields; omitted fields stay unchanged, while empty phone/address arrays clear those collections |
| `deleteContact` | Delete a contact by UID |

### Calendar

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `listCalendars` | List all calendars with read-only, event, and task support flags |
| `createEvent` | Create a calendar event -- opens a review dialog; direct creation via `skipReview` requires explicitly disabling the default safety block. Accepts `status: tentative \| confirmed \| cancelled` (VEVENT STATUS per iCal RFC 5545). |
| `listEvents` | Query events by date range with recurring event expansion. Returns `status` on each event. |
| `updateEvent` | Modify an event's title, dates, location, description, or `status` |
| `deleteEvent` | Delete a calendar event by ID |
| `createTask` | Open a pre-filled task dialog for review; direct creation via `skipReview` requires explicitly disabling the default safety block |
| `listTasks` | List tasks/to-dos from calendars -- filter by completion status, due date, or calendar |
| `updateTask` | Update a task's title, due date, description, priority, completion status, or percent complete |

### Access Control

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `getAccountAccess` | View which accounts the MCP server can access |

Account and tool access are configured via the extension settings page (Tools > Add-ons > Thunderbird MCP > Options). Access control is not MCP-exposed -- only the user can change it.

The same settings page has a "Send Safety" section. **Block `skipReview`** is enabled by default and rejects `skipReview: true` for `sendMail`, `replyToMessage`, `forwardMessage`, `createEvent`, and `createTask`; their review window or dialog still opens normally. `skipReview` is honored only after you explicitly disable this preference.

---

## Setup

### 1. Install the extension

```bash
git clone https://github.com/punshs/thunderbird-mcp.git
```

Install `dist/thunderbird-mcp.xpi` in Thunderbird (Tools > Add-ons > Install from File), then restart. A pre-built XPI is included in the repo -- no build step needed.

**Fork updates:** Install builds from this repository manually. The upstream automatic-update URL is intentionally absent, so an upstream release cannot replace this customized fork.

### 2. Configure your MCP client

Add to your MCP client config (e.g. `~/.claude.json` for Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thunderbird-mail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/thunderbird-mcp/mcp-bridge.cjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Sandbox-aware connection discovery

The bridge re-discovers `connection.json` on every cache miss. It tries these locations in order:

1. `THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE`, if set
2. Native temp dir: `<os.tmpdir()>/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json`
3. macOS fallback: `/var/folders/*/*/T/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json` owned by the current user
4. Linux Snap: Thunderbird's live `TMPDIR` from `/proc/<pid>/environ`, plus the official snap fallback under `~/Downloads/thunderbird.tmp`
5. Linux Flatpak / Betterbird Flatpak: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/app/*/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json`

This covers native installs, the official Thunderbird snap, Thunderbird Flatpak, Thunderbird Beta Flatpak, and Betterbird Flatpak without changing the extension side. If multiple sandbox candidates exist at once, the bridge tries the newest file first. Set `THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE` to force a single explicit path.

Example override:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thunderbird-mail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/thunderbird-mcp/mcp-bridge.cjs"],
      "env": {
        "THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/connection.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Your AI can now access Thunderbird.

---

## Security

- **Auth tokens**: The HTTP server requires a session-scoped bearer token. Generated on startup, written to `<TmpD>/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json` with 0600 permissions. The bridge re-discovers that file automatically across native installs, Snap, Flatpak, Betterbird Flatpak, and macOS temp directories.
- **Dynamic port**: Tries ports 8765-8774, records the actual port in the connection file. No hardcoded port dependency.
- **Account access control**: Restrict which email accounts are visible to MCP clients via the settings page. Changes take effect immediately.
- **Tool access control**: Disable specific tools via the settings page. Disabled tools are hidden from `tools/list` and blocked at dispatch.
- **Localhost only**: By default, the server binds to localhost only. The "Listen on all interfaces" option in settings binds to all IPv4 interfaces for WSL, Docker, or remote access. **This exposes the MCP server to every device on your local network.** Only enable on trusted networks. Auth token is always required.
- **Auto-update integrity**: Auto-update is a code-delivery channel whose integrity depends on continued control of the GitHub repository, the GitHub Actions token, and the `tomaszkasperczyk.name` registration.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Extension not loading | Check Tools > Add-ons and Themes. Errors: Tools > Developer Tools > Error Console |
| Connection refused | Make sure Thunderbird is running and the extension is enabled |
| Bridge can't find `connection.json` | Set `THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE` explicitly if your environment uses a non-standard temp/runtime path |
| Missing recent emails | IMAP folders can be stale. Click the folder in Thunderbird to sync, or right-click > Properties > Repair Folder |
| Tool not found after update | Reconnect MCP (`/mcp` in Claude Code) to pick up new tools |
| `searchBody` returns no results | IMAP accounts need offline sync enabled for Gloda to index message bodies |
| `rawSource` fails on IMAP | Requires local/offline message copy. Enable offline sync or click the message first to cache it. |

---

## Development

```bash
# Build the extension
./scripts/build.sh

# Test via the bridge (handles auth automatically)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | node mcp-bridge.cjs

# Test the HTTP API directly.
# On Snap / Flatpak / Betterbird Flatpak / macOS, point CONN_FILE at the
# real file or export THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE first.
CONN_FILE="${THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE:-/tmp/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json}"
TOKEN=$(jq -r .token "$CONN_FILE")
PORT=$(jq -r .port "$CONN_FILE")
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

**Dev-only extension reload:** After changing extension source locally, remove the add-on from Thunderbird, restart, reinstall the XPI, and restart again. Thunderbird caches aggressively. Regular users should install v0.7.3 once and let auto-update handle later releases.

## Known issues

- IMAP folder databases can be stale until you click on them in Thunderbird
- HTML-only emails are converted to plain text (original formatting is lost)
- Recurring calendar event CRUD operates on the series, not individual occurrences
- IMAP folder operations (rename, delete, move) are async -- verify with `listFolders` after
- Combining tags with move/trash on IMAP may not preserve tags on the moved copy -- use separate calls
- Pre-existing Thunderbird filters with cross-account move/copy targets are not restricted by account access control
- `searchBody` on IMAP without offline sync only searches headers (Gloda limitation)
- `rawSource` requires offline message copy for IMAP -- online-only messages will error

## Editing an open draft

1. Call `listComposeWindows` to identify the existing window, then `getComposeWindow` to read its current content and revision.
2. Pass its `composeId`, `expectedRevision`, and a `changes` object to `updateComposeWindow`. Supported fields are `subject`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `body` (HTML windows), and `plainTextBody` (plain-text windows). Address fields are arrays; omitted fields stay unchanged. Sender identity, attachments, threading and compose format cannot be changed by this tool.
3. A body update replaces the **entire body**, including any signature and quoted correspondence. Preserve those from the read result when revising only the reply text. A subject-only change leaves the body untouched.
4. If a draft changed since it was read, reread and reconcile instead of retrying with an old revision. Updates serialize per window and briefly lock its editor; account access is checked again before mutation.
5. Call `saveComposeWindow` with the latest revision when a saved draft is wanted. It leaves the window open and returns Thunderbird's native save receipt. Saving may change draft metadata; reread before another operation.

Compose IDs/revisions last only for the extension session. Closed or inaccessible windows are rejected. Listing reports per-window read errors rather than hiding a partial result. These tools neither send nor close drafts; listing existing replies helps an assistant avoid creating duplicates, but automatic deduplication is not implemented.

Validated with unit tests and an isolated Thunderbird profile containing dummy mail. Activation of this experiment-API add-on may require restarting Thunderbird; save real open drafts before restarting.
